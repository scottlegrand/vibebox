# Artillery Chain Reaction Game Rules

## Variables
Config.BOARD_SIZE is 8

## Game Board

- Grid-based board of size `Config.BOARD_SIZE x Config.BOARD_SIZE`
- Each cell is `Config.CELL_SIZE` pixels selected to fit the application's window
- Board positioned at `(boardX, boardY)` with UI margin

## Game Pieces
- Three types of artillery pieces:
  - Horizontal pieces (green): Fire in four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right)
  - Diagonal pieces (red): Fire in four diagonal directions
    - Each artillery piece has:
    - Base with colored center
    - Barrels showing the 4 firing directions all emanating from a central turret on top of the base
    - Barrels resemble a top view of a gun barrel and are colored a dull metallic gray
    - Detonation indicators showing impact zones
  - 8 directional pieces (blue) that fire in both cardinal and diagonal directions
    - At most one of these per level and not utilized until level 10 
- Monoliths:
  - Placed on board during level initialization in tiles that are not detonation zones for the solution to the level
  - Look like piles of boulders that are the ruins of some sort of statue or building
- Targets
  - 3 concentric red and white rings like an archery target as seen from above

## Gameplay Mechanics
- Pieces start in tray below board
- Drag pieces from tray to board
- Placement rules:
  - Only on empty cells
  - Cannot place on targets, monoliths or other artillery units
  - Shows detonation pattern when placed
  - Pieces can be moved around board or even placed back in the tray below board
- Chain reaction system:
  - "Detonate" button triggers reactions
  - Selected piece fires first (random if none selected)
  - Hit pieces fire in sequence
  - Reactions continue until no more pieces hit

## Level Generation Rules
- Level 1:
  - 1 horizontal piece
  - 1 target placed in center
- Level 2:
  - 1 diagonal piece
  - 2 targets placed separated by one space vertically or horizontally
- Level 3+:
  - Number of artillery pieces: 2 + (level-2)/2, capped at 8
  - Number of Targets: 3 + (level - 2) / 5 capped at 5
  - Random mix of horizontal and diagonal pieces
  - First piece placed anywhere except edges
  - Subsequent pieces placed in detonation zones of existing pieces
  - Each target must be in detonation zone of at least one piece
  - Targets cannot be placed on existing targets
  - Targets placed in detonation zones that do not have an artillery piece or target in them already
  - Each piece can only have one target in its detonation zone

## Objectives
- Arrange pieces on board to hit all targets in chain reaction
- Level complete when all targets hit
- If a detonation fails to destroy all targets, the targets and any detonated artillery pieces are restored for another attempt to beat the level

## UI Elements
- Score display
- Detonate button
- Undo button that will let you undo every move up through the first move
- Level completion screen
- Continue button

## Special Rules
- Return pieces to tray when dropped in tray area
- Invalid placements return to previous position
- Undo functionality tracks piece positions
- Detonation patterns shown on selection/placement
